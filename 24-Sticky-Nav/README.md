# 24 - Sticky Nav

## Things I learned
- We can add class in body and use this as universal for CSS to change other components
- `window.addEventListener('scroll', fixNav);` about this that scroll event exist in window.
- Various offset heights & scrollY like things.

## Some important things
- In logo we have to kept max-width as without it the transtion will not happen.
- `body.fixed-nav` for making it stick & when both classes are in same tag then it will work.
